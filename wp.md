# Parallel Perps: Capital-Efficient Perpetual Futures on Monad

## Abstract

Parallel Perps introduces a revolutionary decentralized perpetual futures trading platform built on the Monad blockchain. By leveraging Monad's high-throughput capabilities and parallelized architecture, we create a trading experience that rivals centralized exchanges while maintaining true decentralization. Our innovative dual-purpose system allows users to generate yield on staked MON tokens while simultaneously using the derivative token (hasMON) as trading collateral, creating unprecedented capital efficiency in DeFi derivatives trading.

## 1. Introduction

The decentralized derivatives market has been hampered by significant limitations: poor execution, capital inefficiency, and suboptimal user experiences. Parallel Perps solves these problems through a groundbreaking architecture that leverages Monad's parallel processing capabilities to deliver a trading platform with:

- Sub-second trade execution and settlement
- Capital-efficient use of staked assets as collateral
- Yield generation on trading collateral
- Professional-grade trading interface

The perpetual futures market has grown exponentially, with daily volumes exceeding $100B across centralized platforms. However, these centralized solutions expose users to counterparty risk, require trust in third-party custody, and often exclude users from certain jurisdictions. Decentralized alternatives have emerged but suffer from poor execution, capital inefficiency, and high gas costs.

Parallel Perps bridges this gap by providing a fully decentralized trading experience with the performance characteristics of centralized platforms.

## 2. Core Innovation: The hasMON System

### 2.1 Dual-Purpose Token Design

At the heart of Parallel Perps is the hasMON token, a derivative representation of staked MON. This innovation serves two critical functions:

1. **Yield Generation**: When users stake MON, they receive hasMON tokens that accrue yield through validator delegation
2. **Trading Collateral**: hasMON can be used as collateral for trading perpetual futures, allowing users to earn yield on their collateral

This dual functionality creates a capital-efficient ecosystem where users' assets are continuously productive, even when allocated as trading margin.

### 2.2 Staking Mechanism

The staking process is streamlined for user convenience:

1. Users deposit MON tokens into the MonadStaking contract
2. The contract mints hasMON tokens at a 1:1 ratio initially
3. The staked MON is delegated to Monad validators
4. Validators generate staking rewards
5. Rewards are distributed to hasMON holders, increasing the MON:hasMON ratio over time

As the protocol accumulates rewards, the redemption value of hasMON gradually increases, creating an appreciation mechanism similar to liquid staking derivatives.

### 2.3 Yield Distribution

Yield distribution follows an elegant model:

1. Staked MON generates validator rewards
2. The YieldDelegation contract harvests these rewards
3. The RewardDistributor contract distributes rewards to hasMON holders
4. Users can choose to auto-compound rewards or claim them

This system creates a seamless yield-generating mechanism that requires minimal user intervention while maximizing returns.

## 3. Trading Infrastructure

### 3.1 Parallelized Order Book

Parallel Perps implements a parallelized order book system leveraging Monad's unique architecture:

1. Orders are processed in parallel by market segment
2. Matching engine operates at near-centralized exchange speeds
3. Settlement occurs on-chain with minimal latency

This design enables:

- High-frequency trading capabilities
- Tight spreads comparable to centralized exchanges
- Deep liquidity through efficient market making

### 3.2 Perpetual Futures Design

Our perpetual futures implement industry-standard mechanisms with DeFi-native enhancements:

1. **Funding Rate Mechanism**: Balanced through an 8-hour TWAP calculation
2. **Mark Price Calculation**: Resistant to manipulation through multi-source time-weighted oracle feeds
3. **Position Sizing**: Flexible leverage up to 50x with dynamic limits based on market conditions
4. **Liquidation Mechanism**: Tiered liquidation with partial liquidations prioritized over full position closure

### 3.3 Risk Management System

Our risk management system ensures platform stability:

1. **Insurance Fund**: 5% of all trading fees accumulate in an insurance fund to cover socialized losses
2. **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic trading pauses during extreme volatility
3. **Dynamic Margin Requirements**: Margin requirements adjust based on market volatility and position concentration
4. **Liquidation Incentives**: Efficient liquidation mechanism with incentives for liquidators

## 4. User Experience

- Risk management tools

### 4.2 User Journey

The platform provides a seamless user experience:

1. **Onboarding**: Connect wallet, deposit MON, and receive hasMON
2. **Staking**: Earn automatic yields on staked MON
3. **Trading**: Use hasMON as collateral for perpetual futures trading
4. **Management**: Monitor positions, adjust leverage, and manage risk
5. **Analysis**: Track performance through comprehensive analytics

### 4.3 Mobile Optimization

A responsive design ensures critical functions are accessible across devices:

- Position monitoring on-the-go
- Trade execution optimized for mobile
- Simplified charts and data visualization
- Push notifications for position status

## 5. Technical Architecture

### 5.1 Smart Contract Infrastructure

Parallel Perps is built on a modular smart contract system:

1. **MonadStaking**: Manages MON staking and hasMON minting
2. **HasMon**: ERC-20 implementation of the staking derivative
3. **YieldDelegation**: Manages validator delegation and reward collection
4. **RewardDistributor**: Handles fair distribution of staking rewards
5. **hasMONCollateral**: Manages collateral for trading positions
6. **PerpEngine**: Implements core perpetual futures logic
7. **OrderBook**: Maintains and matches trading orders

### 5.2 Frontend Architecture

The frontend leverages modern web technologies:

2. **Validator Network**: Monad validators for staking rewards
3. **Indexing**: The Graph or custom indexer for efficient data access
4. **Analytics Engine**: Custom analytics for trading metrics

## 6. Tokenomics

### 6.1 hasMON Mechanics

hasMON implements a rebasing mechanism where its value relative to MON increases as staking rewards accumulate:

- Initial ratio: 1 hasMON = 1 MON
- As rewards accumulate: 1 hasMON > 1 MON
- Unstaking: Users receive MON based on current redemption ratio

### 6.2 Fee Structure

Parallel Perps implements a transparent fee structure:

1. **Trading Fees**: 0.05% maker / 0.10% taker
2. **Fee Distribution**:
    - 70% to hasMON stakers as additional yield
    - 20% to protocol treasury
    - 5% to insurance fund
    - 5% to buyback and burn program

### 6.3 Incentive Alignment

Our tokenomics creates aligned incentives:

1. Traders are incentivized to stake MON to reduce trading costs
2. Stakers are incentivized to trade to increase platform revenues
3. Long-term holders benefit from buyback and burn programs
